    "The data consist of $p$ variables observed on $n$ individuals. Let $Y_{ij}$ represent the observation of the $j$-th variable on the $i$-th individual ($i=1,\\dots,n$, $j=1,\\dots,p$). Futhermore denote colummn vector of observations corresponding to the $j-$ th variable $Y_{\\cdot j}=(Y_{1j}\\dots,Y_{nj})^T$, whereas the row vector referring to data on the $i$-th individual is denoted by $Y_{i\\cdot}=(Y_{i1},\\dots,Y_{ip})$, and let $Y$ be tha matrix of all the observations.\n",
    " \n",
    "The data typically consists of continuous measurement, binary variables or counts. Each variable is assigned a distribution which quite often is the Normal, Bernoulli and Poisson depending on the variable type. The standard procedure of MCDA in the context of benefit risk analysis is to approve the use of drug with the highest score. Denoting by $\\mu_j=E(Y_{\\cdot j})$ the score of the $d$ drug is defined as\n",

    "### Statistical Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the formula above does not take into account the uncertainty in the estimates of $\\hat{\\mu_j}$. Hence it cannot be used to draw statistical inference on the drug score. To address this Wen et al (2014) adopt a Normal approximation to the distribution of each $Y_{i\\cdot}$ and using the Delta method to derive the asymptotic distribution of $\\hat{S_d}(Y)$. This can facilitate the construction of asymptotic intervals and hypothesis tests, although a Monte Carlo approach was also suggested. **KK notes: doesn't allow for mixed data correlation for binary variables, approximate, non-parsimonious**\n",
    "\n",
    "A Bayesian approach was adopted in Phillips et al (??? Modelling Rosi for ....). The parameters $\\mu_j$ were assummed to be independent a-posteriori thus implying a joint posterior being the product of the $\\mu_j$ posteriors. The latter were obtained by assigning conjugate prior for each $j$ depending on the variable type. The ability to sample from the joint posterior of the $\\mu_j$'s allows to draw samples from the posterior of $S_d$ and caculate quantities such as the posterior probability of drug having better score than another. **KK notes: independence assumption, posterior vs predictive distribution**.\n",

    "### Proposed approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Our proposed approach retains the desirables characteristics of the the existing framwork, such as handling parameter uncertainty, and provides improvement in the following ways:\n",

    " 1. Accounts for dependence account while allowing for mixed data without relying on the asumptotic normality approximations.\n",
    " 2. Allows using the posterior predictive distribution\n",
    " 3. Addresses issues of model goodness of fit and parsimony\n",
    " \n",
    "It consists of the following step\n",
    " \n",
    "  1. Assign a model on Y that allows for dependence and sample from the posterior of the parameters vector that includes the $\\mu_j$'s.\n",
    "  2. Plug each posterior MCMC sample $k$ of the $\\mu_j$'s to obtain a sample from $S_d(\\mu)$. These samples can be used to ... \n",
    "  3. The MCMC samples from the posterior MCMC sample $k$ of the parameters draw a $Y_i^{(k)}$ given the value of the parameters to obtain a sample from the posterior-predictive. These samples can be used to caclulate quantities such as the probability of one medicinal product having higher score than the other.\n",

    "The Wen et al (2014) provides some justification on including the correlations. Further motivation, from the Bayesian angle, is provided by the following example \n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Assumme $Y_i\\sim N(\\mu,\\Sigma)$ where $\\mu=(\\mu_1,\\dots,\\mu_p)$ and $\\Sigma$ is a $p\\times p$ covariance matrix (i.e. symmetric and positive definite). Further assume linear $h_j(\\cdot)$'s. Without loss of generality we can write \n",
